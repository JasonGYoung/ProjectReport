\chapter{Conclusion}
TEBNF merges the strengths of declarative and imperative programming paradigms into one format.  A prototype code generation tool was presented that accepts a TEBNF grammar as its sole input specification.  The prototype code generation tool demonstrated how TEBNF makes it possible to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Integrate lexical analysis and parsing input specifications into one format.
  \item Generate C++ classes that handle IO over console, file, or UDP/IP, and abstract the complexities of their usage through TEBNF.
  \item Generate C++ classes that simultaneously unmarshal and match incoming input data to TEBNF grammar patterns.
  \item Describe the execution path of an application that accepts input over various IO methods, is able to parse that input, use it, and send output over various IO methods.
\end{itemize}

Software developers using TEBNF are able to focus on what they want to implement rather than how to represent their designs in a language like C++.  TEBNF embodies the idea of using additional levels of indirection to solve problems in computer science.
