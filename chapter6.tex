\chapter{Conclusion}
Errors and inconsistencies between code components can be very costly in a software project.  It has been shown that the use of code generation tools can simplify and possibly reduce these errors and inconsistencies.  Many tools generate only one of the many components found in a typical application.  This report explored the benefits of using TEBNF as the sole input specification for the TEBNF code generation tool.

The TEBNF input specification integrates lexical analysis and parsing input specifications into one format.  TEBNF also simplifies the implementation of applications that receive, parse, process, and output data through various I/O methods.  Many complexities involved with designing and coding applications can be abstracted using TEBNF.

The prototype TEBNF code generation tool demonstrated the effectiveness of TEBNF as an input specification.  The tool generates C++ classes that handles I/O over console, file, or UDP/IP, thereby abstracting the complexities of their usage through TEBNF.  Parsing documented formats like the NITF 2.1 format is greatly simplified using TEBNF.
