Errors and inconsistencies between code components can be very costly in a software project.  Efforts to reduce these costs can include the use of tools that limit human interaction with code by generating it from a description.  This paper introduces two new works to address these issues: (1) an input specification called Typed EBNF (TEBNF), and (2) a prototype tool that demonstrates how TEBNF can be used to generate code.  The tool generates code for a console application as described by a TEBNF grammar.  An application built from the generated code will be able to receive input data, parse it, process it, and output it as needed.
